            spontaneous getaways possible. Gone are the days when owning a car
            was a necessity. Today, choosing a car hire gives you all the
            mobility and privacy you need, without digging deep into your
            pockets.

          <h4>Unlock Guidelines for Car Rental in India</h4>
          <p>
            COVID-19 restrictions are relaxing in several places around India.
            It means that travel is becoming easier. To ensure complete safety,
            you can rent cars that are sanitized and well maintained. Car rental
            service is available on redBus, and you can book it while following
            all the pandemic related guidelines. Following are some unlocking
            guidelines that you need to remember while booking a car rental on
            redBus - Luxury cars are available for car rental in several cities
            around India. People travelling across states may have to submit the
            RT-PCR test report. Tourists should refer to the guidelines for
            specific locations and adhere to them while travelling. For travel
            via car within the state, double vaccine shots might be necessary.
            The protocols change from state to state, and it is important to
            check them before renting a car. A temperature check is conducted
            for all passengers and the driver before the start of the journey.
            All cars available on redBus can only be rented if all safety
            protocols are maintained. redBus provides cars with skilled drivers
            who follow all guidelines during the journey. Passengers are also
            encouraged to use the sanitisers available in the vehicle. Drivers
            and passengers have to wear masks while travelling. In this unlock
            phase, cities like Hyderabad, Bangalore, Madurai and Visakhapatnam
            have opened tourist destinations. You can rent cars from redBus for
            road trips, pilgrimages, and family programs. Car rental service is
            also available for inter-state business trips. In several cities,
            public transport is still functioning at a limited capacity. Opting
            for a car rental service is a better option as it is safer. Groups
            of 4, 5 or 7 people can rent a car for travel.

            transport only services selected routes and stops, but with car

            stops as you want along the way. Car rental services are readily

            fastest routes. You can also choose to turn the wheel over to a
            professional driver to focus on work, phone calls, or simply gazing
            out the window. Easy online car booking: Today, you no longer need

          <h4>Types of Cars Available For Rent</h4>
          <p>
            Just like one size doesnt fit all, one car cant be used in various
            situations and environments. For example, you cant drive a small
            hatchback over rugged roads without ruining the vehicle; similarly,
            you cant have more than five people sit comfortably in a sedan. For
            a shopping trip or a one-person car ride, it seems wasteful to book
            out a massive SUV. Luckily, with redBus car rental services, you
            have various car models to choose from, depending on your budget and
            your use for the car. Heres a glimpse of seating arrangements and
